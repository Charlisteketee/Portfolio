      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        <p>Hello! I'm Charli Steketee, a passionate Full Stack Web Developer with a background in finance. After completing my diploma at Lighthouse Labs, I embarked on a journey to transform my career and pursue my true passion for coding. With two wonderful children and a love for sports, traveling, and food, I've found a unique blend of inspiration and motivation to create impactful web solutions.</p>

        <p>My transition into web development was fueled by a desire to combine my analytical skills honed in finance with my creative side. This fusion has enabled me to craft applications that are not only functional but also user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing.</p>

        <p>Get in Touch</p>
        <p>If you're curious about my work or want to collaborate on a project, feel free to reach out. You can also check out my GitHub page to see some of the code I've written and contributed to. I'm always open to connecting with fellow developers, potential employers, or anyone interested in discussing the latest trends in web development.</p>
